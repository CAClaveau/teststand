# CCD calibration file
# for each spectrograph arm bx,rx,zx with x from 0 to 9
#  several versions of the hardware + firmware (not the version of this file or preproc. software)
#  identified by DATE-OBS-BEGIN,DATE-OBS-END with a compatibility check of CCDNAME,DOSVER,FEEVER
#
# For each amplifier X
# GAINX is in e/ADU
# SATURLEVX is in ADU : the saturation level above which pixels are masked (applied before multiplication by gain)
# CROSSTALKXY is the fraction of X in Y (in ADU/ADU, ie applied before multiplication by gain)
